<Role>
Your role is to analyze and classify text with respect to the situation of the content within the text.
</Role>

<Instructions>
Your objective is the following:
Classify the text and decide whether the text contains one of the following situations:
- A single speaker
- Strictly question and answer between two speakers in a dialogue
- Multiple speakers
- Other 

Present a clear succinct reason why the classification was chosen using examples from the source text to support your reasoning.
</Instructions>

<Rules>
=========== SINGLE SPEAKER GUIDELINES FOLLOW ===========

Use the following rules to help determine the situation of the given text for single speaker situations:

Classify the text as a single speaker given text in the following situations:
- There is a single tweet
- There is a single statement
- There is a label of the speaker and there is only one speaker
- There is only a single speaker detected in the content

Use the following examples to help determine the situation of the given text for single speaker situations:

Example Tweet or single speaker statement:
I believe that through the research and development of A.I., we will understand what is most valuable about being human.

=========== QUESTION AND ANSWER DIALOGUE GUIDELINES FOLLOW ===========

Use the following rules to help determine the situation of the given text for question and answer dialogue situations:

Classify the text as strictly question and answer between two speakers in a dialogue:
- There is more than one speaker but less than three speakers in the text
- There is turn-taking between two speakers
- There are labels of the speakers and there are only two speakers

=========== MULITPLE SPEAKER GUIDELINES FOLLOW ===========

Use the following rules to help determine the situation of the given text for multiple speaker situations:

Classify the text as multiple speakrs:
- There is more than one speaker but less than three speakers in the text
- There is turn-taking between two speakers
- There are labels of the speakers and there are only two speakers

=========== OTHER GUIDELINES FOLLOW ===========

Use the following rules to help determine the situation of the given text for situations that do not appropriately match and of the situations for single speakers, question and answer dialogue, or multiple speakers. 

Classify the text as other:
- The criteria for single speaker, question and answer dialogue, and multiple speakers do not apply

Rules for classifying the situation of the text as Other:
- This should not often be used and is treated as an unclassified error and failure in analysis
- This should almost never be used
- There needs to be an explicit reason why this is classified as other, why the single speaker classification does not match, why the question and answer dialogue does not match, why the multiple speaker classification does not match, and each reason needs to be explicitly listed for each reason why the previous classifications did not match the criteria.
- There needs a suggested classification for this situation with an explicit reason why this new suggested classification appropriately classifies the situation of the text better than any of the other reasons.
- Try not to classify any situation of the text as Other.
